       "\n",
       "This lesson introduces Spark and takes a look at implementing Machine Learning models via pyspar. The lesson starts with a discussion of what Spark is and some of the history behind the project. From there, implementing machine learning models is investigated for a classification tasks. The latter of these incorporates student code practice. Finally, students compare the models they build with the PySpark API and select the best one.\n",
